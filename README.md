## 1. Introduction
This document demonstrates how to deploy open-source AI models (e.g., LLaMA, Whisper, Mistral, Gemma) on cloud platforms like Cloudera, and how to create an API endpoint similar to OpenAI's API. The API will accept various types of data (image, audio, text, or combinations) and return processed responses. 

## 2. Cloud Machine Setup

### 2.1 Cloud Platform Options
You can rent cloud machines from the following platforms:
- **DigitalOcean**
- **Cloudera**
- **runpod** 
- **AWS**
- **Google Cloud**
- **Microsoft Azure**

Choose a platform based on cost and availability of GPU resources.

### 2.2 Hardware and Software Requirements
- **GPU**: Recommended (e.g., NVIDIA A100, V100, 4x A40 OR 2x A100) for fine-tuning and inference.
- **RAM**: 16 GB or more (recommended).
- **Storage**: 100 GB or more.

    - The Choice of GPU 
      - Llama 3.1 70B FP16: 4x A40 or 2x A100
      - Llama 3.1 70B INT8: 1x A100 or 2x A40
      - Llama 3.1 70B INT4: 1x A40

Software:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **PyTorch**
- **Transformers** (Hugging Face)
- **BitsAndBytes** (for QLoRA)

## 5. Fine-Tuning the Model

### 5.1 Introduction to PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)
PEFT is a general strategy aimed at fine-tuning large models efficiently by updating only a small subset of parameters or adding a few new parameters, while keeping most of the pre-trained model parameters frozen. The idea is to reduce the number of trainable parameters, thus lowering the memory requirements and computational load during training.

- Goal: To fine-tune large pre-trained models with fewer computational resources by adjusting only a fraction of the parameters.
- Method: PEFT methods introduce small, additional parameter sets (like adapters, or only fine-tuning specific layers), which help capture
task-specific knowledge without modifying the entire model.
- Applications: PEFT can be used for tasks where large pre-trained models are needed, but you don't have the resources to fine-tune all parameters.

### 5.2 Introduction to LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
LoRA is a specific PEFT method that injects low-rank matrices into transformer layers to modify the weights for specific downstream tasks. Rather than fine-tuning the entire model or specific layers, LoRA decomposes the parameter matrices into low-rank forms and only fine-tunes these low-rank matrices.

- Goal: To reduce the number of trainable parameters and memory usage while fine-tuning large models.
- Method: LoRA adds a pair of low-rank matrices (A and B) into the attention mechanism of transformers. These matrices are smaller in size compared to the original weights, and only these matrices are updated during fine-tuning.
- Key Benefit: You fine-tune only a small set of new parameters (the low-rank matrices), making training more efficient.
- Applications: LoRA is commonly used for fine-tuning large models like GPT, BERT, or T5 for specific tasks, allowing users to work with very large models on lower-resource hardware.

### 5.3 Introduction to QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)
QLoRA extends LoRA by introducing quantization to further reduce the memory requirements of large models. In this method, the base model's parameters are quantized (typically from 16-bit or 32-bit floating-point to 4-bit or 8-bit integers), reducing the memory footprint. Then, like LoRA, low-rank matrices are introduced to perform task-specific fine-tuning.

- Goal: To fine-tune large models on resource-constrained hardware with minimal performance degradation.
- Method: QLoRA performs 4-bit quantization of the pre-trained model's parameters to reduce the size of the model in memory. The quantized model is then fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation like in LoRA. The fine-tuning is done on the low-rank matrices, but with quantized weights, the overall computational and memory load is much lower.
- Key Benefit: QLoRA enables fine-tuning of models that would otherwise be too large for normal hardware setups by compressing them and still allowing for efficient updates via LoRA.
- Applications: QLoRA is ideal for very large language models (e.g., models with hundreds of billions of parameters) and is especially useful for fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware, like GPUs with limited memory.
